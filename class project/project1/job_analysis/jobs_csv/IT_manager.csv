Facility: Rockville: 9609 MedCtrDr
Location: 9609 Medical Center Dr, Rockville, MD 20850 USA
The Frederick National Laboratory is dedicated to improving human health through discovery and innovation in the biomedical sciences, focusing on cancer, AIDS, and emerging infectious diseases. 
Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc. (LBR) operates the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR), a Federally Funded Research and Development Center focused on cancer and AIDS research, on behalf of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). It also manages the federal government's only vaccine manufacturing facilities and the high-performance Advanced Biomedical Computing Center.
LBR's Molecular Characterization Laboratory (MoCha) develops and performs clinical assays in support of the NCI's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD). As a dedicated and approved government contractor, MoCha is responsible for providing genomic assay support for DCTD-sponsored clinical trials and has developed stringent quality systems to ensure the strictest adherence to regulatory requirements and expectations of patient confidentiality and specimen integrity. 
DCTD and MoCha are jointly responsible for the NCI Cancer Moonshot Biobank program, a new and innovative clinical trial which is intended to accelerate cancer research in key strategic areas that were identified by experts convened in 2016 through a ""Blue Ribbon Panel"" (https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative/blue-ribbon-panel). The strategic areas have in common two core elements: (1) critical scientific and medical questions, the answers to which could rapidly accelerate progress in cancer research, and (2) the need for nationwide participation by a diverse group of research subjects who have agreed to share their biospecimens and/or derived data to contribute to progress in cancer research.
Up to 2,000 longitudinal samples from patients with ~10 different cancer types will be collected at biospecimen source sites (BSS) and utilized by researchers studying mechanisms of drug resistance and sensitivity and other important questions. Next-generation sequencing tests will be performed to inform patient treatment decisions. Some samples will be sent to FNLCR for patient derived xenograft model development. A central Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR) will be engaged for sample processing and storage. A patient and provider engagement website will be used to securely provide information (consent forms, clinical report) to participants/providers, and provide trial information to potential participants. An electronic consent tool and video will be deployed at the BSS to facilitate engagement. Clinical and specimen data will be collected in Theradex's Medidata Rave. Select clinical, specimen, and inventory data will be available through an online biospecimen catalog system to reduce barriers to researchers interested in using biospecimens for research. Project data will be uploaded to various NCI data repositories (e.g. Sequence Read Archive, Cancer Research Data Commons, dbGap, and The Cancer Imaging Archive), which provide access to the broader research community.
This is a challenging and rewarding opportunity to lead the creation of a complex IT system in a high-visibility cancer research setting. Components of the system will interface with clinical data stores, public databases, researchers, physicians, and cancer patients. The successful applicant will help orchestrate subcontractors and Federal stakeholder input to produce a smoothly operating, distributed data management system that maintains patient privacy, while providing research data to both scientists and the patients themselves. 
This position will be located in Rockville, Maryland.
