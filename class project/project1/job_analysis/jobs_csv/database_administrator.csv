In support of that mission, the Director will act as the Marketing Cloud resident expert, ensuring that the new Marketing Cloud implementation is setup and configured correctly using best-in-class methods and according to the business rules and data structure representative of the organization. This includes how best to handle management of donors, supporters, club memberships, etc. as it relates to defining data required in Marketing Cloud vs existing BlackBaud CRM (BBCRM), leveraging subscriber keys and other unique constituent identifiers, email addresses, opt-ins and opt-outs, personalization and other key decisions that will affect the behavior of the system and the ability of Marketing Cloud to meet the business and legal needs of. It also will entail ensuring how financial donation transactions, order tracking of Trick-or-Treat boxes, etc. are handled within Salesforce or on another platform and which data is needed to be stored in Marketing Cloud.
The Director, working with external implementation partners and with internal colleagues from departments across the organization, will be the lead internal resource for directing and potentially reviewing decisions to ensure Marketing Cloud has been positioned optimally for success. The Marketing Cloud Specialist will work hand-in-hand with the Digital Technology’s Solutions Architect on decisions regarding right-sizing Marketing Cloud databases, archival strategies and solutions, and overall design of data inputs and outputs related to Marketing Cloud.
