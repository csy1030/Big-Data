Second Line is definitely applied a bit inconsistently across the industry, but the basics here are that First Line own and operate the processes and controls that the business run on (so they write, implement, and operate the policies, procedures, and control environment), while Second Line looks over their shoulders to opine on whether those policies, procedures, and control environment are designed appropriately to cover all the relevant risks (all types of risk – compliance/regulatory risk, financial risk, and operational risk).  If the whole Second Line function were to disappear, all the processes to safely operate the company should still be able to function.  So Second Line is the group that’s performing checks (risk assessments and risk monitoring) as well as providing effective challenge (a risk-focused review) of the policies, procedures, and controls designed and operated by the first line.

Second Line is definitely applied a bit inconsistently across the industry, but the basics here are that First Line own and operate the processes and controls that the business run on (so they write, implement, and operate the policies, procedures, and control environment), while Second Line looks over their shoulders to opine on whether those policies, procedures, and control environment are designed appropriately to cover all the relevant risks (all types of risk – compliance/regulatory risk, financial risk, and operational risk).  If the whole Second Line function were to disappear, all the processes to safely operate the company should still be able to function.  So Second Line is the group that’s performing checks (risk assessments and risk monitoring) as well as providing effective challenge (a risk-focused review) of the policies, procedures, and controls designed and operated by the first line.

Second Line is definitely applied a bit inconsistently across the industry, but the basics here are that First Line own and operate the processes and controls that the business run on (so they write, implement, and operate the policies, procedures, and control environment), while Second Line looks over their shoulders to opine on whether those policies, procedures, and control environment are designed appropriately to cover all the relevant risks (all types of risk – compliance/regulatory risk, financial risk, and operational risk).  If the whole Second Line function were to disappear, all the processes to safely operate the company should still be able to function.  So Second Line is the group that’s performing checks (risk assessments and risk monitoring) as well as providing effective challenge (a risk-focused review) of the policies, procedures, and controls designed and operated by the first line.

Second Line is definitely applied a bit inconsistently across the industry, but the basics here are that First Line own and operate the processes and controls that the business run on (so they write, implement, and operate the policies, procedures, and control environment), while Second Line looks over their shoulders to opine on whether those policies, procedures, and control environment are designed appropriately to cover all the relevant risks (all types of risk – compliance/regulatory risk, financial risk, and operational risk).  If the whole Second Line function were to disappear, all the processes to safely operate the company should still be able to function.  So Second Line is the group that’s performing checks (risk assessments and risk monitoring) as well as providing effective challenge (a risk-focused review) of the policies, procedures, and controls designed and operated by the first line.

Second Line is definitely applied a bit inconsistently across the industry, but the basics here are that First Line own and operate the processes and controls that the business run on (so they write, implement, and operate the policies, procedures, and control environment), while Second Line looks over their shoulders to opine on whether those policies, procedures, and control environment are designed appropriately to cover all the relevant risks (all types of risk – compliance/regulatory risk, financial risk, and operational risk).  If the whole Second Line function were to disappear, all the processes to safely operate the company should still be able to function.  So Second Line is the group that’s performing checks (risk assessments and risk monitoring) as well as providing effective challenge (a risk-focused review) of the policies, procedures, and controls designed and operated by the first line.

Second Line is definitely applied a bit inconsistently across the industry, but the basics here are that First Line own and operate the processes and controls that the business run on (so they write, implement, and operate the policies, procedures, and control environment), while Second Line looks over their shoulders to opine on whether those policies, procedures, and control environment are designed appropriately to cover all the relevant risks (all types of risk – compliance/regulatory risk, financial risk, and operational risk).  If the whole Second Line function were to disappear, all the processes to safely operate the company should still be able to function.  So Second Line is the group that’s performing checks (risk assessments and risk monitoring) as well as providing effective challenge (a risk-focused review) of the policies, procedures, and controls designed and operated by the first line.
